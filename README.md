# Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates

The dataset we'll use describes `Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021`. The euro (symbolized with â‚¬) is the official currency in most of the countries of the European Union.

**`Our focus in the guided part of the project will be on the exchange rate between the euro and the American dollar.`**

If the exchange rate of the euro to the US dollar is 1.5, you get 1.5 US dollars if you pay 1.0 euro (one euro has more value than one US dollar at this exchange rate).
